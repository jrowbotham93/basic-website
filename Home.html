						<p>Central School of Art and Design
						The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by London County Council. <br><br>
						
					 It grew directly from the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris and John Ruskin. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was William Richard Lethaby; a blue plaque in his memory was erected in 1957.[7] The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the Regent Street Polytechnic. It moved to purpose-built premises in Southampton Row, in the London Borough of Camden, in 1908.[8] In the same year the Royal Female School of Art, established in 1842, was merged into the school.[9] Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.[10]</p>
